Methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.
Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage. 
I scorn you, scurvy companion. 
Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him. 
I’ll beat thee, but I would infect my hands.
Your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. 
Poisonous bunch-backed toad! 
Thine forward voice, now, is to speak well of thine friend; thine backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
That poisonous bunch-back’d toad!
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon. 
That trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years?
Villain, I have done thy mother. 
His wit’s as thick as a Tewkesbury mustard.
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows.
Saucy lackey! 
Thou elvish-mark’d, abortive, rooting hog! 
Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! 
More of your conversation would infect my brain. 
What an ass! 
Thine forward voice, now, is to speak well of thine friend; thine backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. 
The rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
Thou cream faced loon.
Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch!
You scullion! You rampallian! You fustilarian! I’ll tickle your catastrophe!
Come, come, you froward and unable worms! 
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss’d with. 
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes. 
Foul spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue, and with thy weapon nothing dares perform. 
My wife’s a hobby horse!
Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage.
I do desire that we may be better strangers. 
I do wish thou were a dog, that I might love thee something. 
Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! 
Thou art a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver’d, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.  
I’ll beat thee, but I would infect my hands. 
O you beast! I’ll so maul you and your toasting-iron, That you shall think the devil is come from hell. 
The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes. 
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat. 
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
Thou lump of foul deformity.
Thou art the cap of all the fools. 
You poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen mate! 
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat.
You are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard. 
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. 
Would thou wouldst burst!
You, minion, are too saucy. 
There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune.
Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy. 
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad.
Thou elvish-mark’d, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch!
By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. 
You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. 
Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade. 
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou! 
You are as a candle, the better burnt out. 
That trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? 
If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
Away, you three-inch fool! 
They have a plentiful lack of wit. 
Thou art a boil, a plague sore.
You have such a February face, so full of frost, of storm and cloudiness. 
Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy.
Thou art as fat as butter.
His wit’s as thick as a Tewkesbury mustard. 
A rare parrot-teacher! 
Whoreson caterpillars, bacon-fed knaves! 
If you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt. 
This woman’s an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure. 
Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. 
You scullion! You rampallian! You fustilarian! I’ll tickle your catastrophe! 
Thou whoreson zed , thou unnecessary letter!
I must tell you friendly in your ear, sell when you can, you are not for all markets. 
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall.
I am sick when I do look on thee.
The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes.
Was the Duke a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward?
Pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. 
You have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness.
Away thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant. 
Thou art unfit for any place but hell.
Would thou wouldst burst! 
There’s small choice in rotten apples. 
A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality.
Peace, ye fat guts!
Thou art unfit for any place but hell. 
Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows! 
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip, she is spherical, like a globe; I could find countries in her.
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon.
He has not so much brain as ear-wax. 
Like the toad; ugly and venomous.
Thine face is not worth sunburning.
You poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen mate!
A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. 
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
Thy tongue outvenoms all the worms of Nile.
Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man!
Four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one: so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left, to be known a reasonable creature. 
The rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril. 
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip, she is spherical, like a globe, I could find out countries in her. 
Thou art as fat as butter. 
Bottled spider! 
What a thrice-double ass! 
Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood. 
You are as a candle, the better burnt out.
Her face is not worth sunburning. 
There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune. 
Thou hateful wither’d hag! 
A fool, an empty purse. There was no money in’t. 
Away, you three-inch fool! 
Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! 
Thou lump of foul deformity.
Threadbare juggler! 
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all. 
I am sick when I do look on thee. 
Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese.
You starvelling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish–O for breath to utter what is like thee!-you tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck!
Thou cream faced loon! 
I must tell you friendly in your ear, sell when you can, you are not for all markets.
Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade.
Away, you mouldy rogue, away! 
Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter! 
Was the Duke a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward? 
Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish! You tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck! 
Eater of broken meats! 
Aroint thee: go away, rump-fed runion: slut.
Like the toad; ugly and venomous. 
My wife’s a hobby horse! 
You should be women, and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so. 
Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! 
Thy tongue outvenoms all the worms of Nile. 
If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. 
I scorn you, scurvy companion. 
She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.  
Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish!
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad. 
This woman’s an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure.
